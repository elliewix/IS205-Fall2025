# if I type something like this

# let's talk about strings (str)
print("11")
# anything in the " " is text
# vs things like integers (int)
print(14) # int
print(15.4) # float
print(16.78442344) # also a float
print(17.0) # even this is a float
print(18) # back to an int

# how do I prove any of this?

print(type(23.435))
